# Task 8: Rule-Based Chatbot using Python

✅ Task Overview

Goal: Create a chatbot that interacts using pre-defined rules (no AI or NLP libraries).

Language: Python

Concepts: if-elif-else, while loop, input() & print()

🧠 Features to Include

Let’s create a simple chatbot that can respond to:

Greetings (hi, hello)

How are you?

What’s your name?

Tell me a joke

Exit/bye command



## 📌 Objective

Build a simple chatbot using Python that responds to user input using rule-based logic (`if-elif-else`). This chatbot simulates a basic conversational interface without using any external NLP or AI libraries.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.13.5
  
- VS Code / Any text editor
  
- Command Line / Terminal

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The chatbot:

- Uses a `while` loop to keep chatting with the user.
  
- Takes input from the user using `input()`.
  
- Responds using `if-elif-else` logic based on keywords or phrases.
  
- Ends the chat when the user types `"bye"`, `"exit"`, or `"quit"`.

## 💡 Sample Interactions

Chatbot: Hello! I am ChatBot. Type 'bye' to exit.

You: hi

Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?

You: tell me a joke

Chatbot: Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus! 😂

You: bye

Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day!

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **Input Handling:** Taking user input with `input()` and processing it with `.lower()`.
- **Control Flow:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions.
- **Loops:** Using a `while` loop to keep the conversation going until the user exits.
- **Basic NLP Logic:** Simulating natural language understanding using keyword matching.
- **Function Definition:** Encapsulating chatbot logic in a function (`def chatbot():`).
